## About the game
This game is a multiplayer strategy game. The players are playing against each other. The players must destroy their opponents base to win the game. They can place 3 different buildings. One of them is a resource generator which generates resources. These resources are needed to build the buildings. The other 2 buildings produce small or big tanks which the player can control with the mouse. 

My main motivation by following this course and creating this game was to learn how multiplayer works. This course thought me the basics of Mirror.
